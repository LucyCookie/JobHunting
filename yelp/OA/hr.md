Most Linux or UNIX users know that there is a kill(1) command to stop processes, but what are the options, what do they mean?

These options are called signals, which can be expressed in either numbers or words. Some known once are "-1" or "-HUP". Also well known is "-9" (aka "-KILL")-google 1point3acres

10. How would you find whether a remote computer is online or not

11. How does the domain name map to ip address
http://www.firewall.cx/networking-topics/protocols/domain-name-system-dns.html


DNS is a very popular and well known protocol. It is used for resolving host names and domain names to IP addresses. The fact is that when you type www.firewall.cx the name is translated into an IP address via a number of queries that take place from your PC towards the DNS server. This DNS Query process (and more) is analysed in great depth in the articles that follow.

鏉ユ簮涓€浜�.涓夊垎鍦拌鍧�. 
HTTP is an application layer protocol designed within the framework of the Internet Protocol Suite. Its definition presumes an underlying and reliable transport layer protocol,[3] and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is commonly used. However HTTP can use unreliable protocols such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), for example in Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP).


14. Full form of SSL and what does it do?   
SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer. The protocol's name is now officially TLS but we will continue to use SSL since that's the better known name.


SSL was designed to permit web browsers and web servers to exchange sensitive information and prevent programs that could view the network traffic from reading the sensitive data..1point3acres缃�

- Is an inner join an intersection, a union or something else?
Inner join - An inner join using either of the equivalent queries gives the intersection of the two tables, i.e. the two rows they have in common.
Left outer join - A left outer join will give all rows in A, plus any common rows in B.
Full outer join - A full outer join will give you the union of A and B, i.e. All the rows in A and all the rows in B. If something in A doesn't have a corresponding datum in B, then the B portion is null, and vice versa.
